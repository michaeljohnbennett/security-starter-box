# Damn Vulnerable DeFi - Truffle Box

This repo has some nice examples of defi contracts with vulnerabilities with different tests and examples of mitigation.

## Unstoppable Deployment

We can deploy the unstoppable contracts now with yarn commands.

Don't forget to disarm the contracts after deplopying if you want to run them against a fuzzing service tool if it needs them armed with scribble annotations.
