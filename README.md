# hackerman-contracts-box
A box of exploitable smart contracts for testing and learning with.

This box is based off the excellent: [Damn Vulnerable DeFi](https://github.com/tinchoabbate/damn-vulnerable-defi) but instead of hacking the contracts to find the exploits we are trying to explore the way we could proactively have avoided these exploits by using different testing modes/tools.
