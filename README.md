# Web3 Security Starter Kit üîê

Speedrun your way to Web3 security appreciation! This box helps you get from limited Web3 security know-how to a strong baseline, including (although not limited to) contract vulnerabilities and mitigations, broader attack vectors, and security tooling.

## Getting Started

This box uses Yarn v3.x. If you are using Node v16.10 or later you can enable it and install the dependencies with the following:

```
corepack enable
yarn install
```

Full detail are at the [yarn site](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install).


## Contents


Under the `packages` folder we have a bunch of projects for you to test out. Each folder has a `README.md` in it for you to get more info but most tie into content on our security site to enable you to learn in a hands-on manner.

So lets get stuck in!
